# MTUL-core
core dependencies for other libraries within MTUL. This is mostly useless atm, just adds binary reading from modlib.
Credits to Appgurue: he basically wrote all original code, it's been highly modified to be modular and to have a working documented interface- but nonetheless none of it would be possible without him.
